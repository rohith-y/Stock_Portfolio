Stock Portfolio Website:
In this website, I have created a user-friendly environment where individuals can easily add their preferred stocks and efficiently keep track of them.
To provide real-time data and display stock information, I have integrated an API that allows users to input the ticker symbol of the desired stock. 
The website then retrieves the relevant data and presents it in a clear and concise manner.
Users have the flexibility to add as many stocks as they desire to their portfolio, enabling them to effectively monitor multiple investments simultaneously. 
The intuitive interface makes it effortless for users to manage and organize their stock holdings.
Additionally, I have implemented a delete operation, which allows users to remove stocks from their portfolio if they no longer wish to track them. 
This feature ensures that users have complete control over the stocks they choose to monitor.
Overall, the Stock Portfolio website provides a seamless and streamlined experience for users to track and monitor their preferred stocks, empowering them to make informed investment decisions.
